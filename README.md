# Take home challenge

## Dependencies

Assumes [TEQC v4.3](https://www.unavco.org/software/data-processing/teqc/teqc.html) is on the path.

## Notes

Didnt quite get around to publiching to NPM so you could global install and run,
but you can use this repo.

Firstly run 
`npm i` to download all dependencies,
Then run `npm start -- nybp 2021-07-25T23:11:22Z 2021-07-26T01:33:44Z`
Where base station id and the times can of course be changed :)
